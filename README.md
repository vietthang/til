This repository is for keeping track my reading and learning. It is also my public bookmarks. :)

## In the past I learned :)

- [When is a dollar not a dollar](https://www.codingvc.com/when-is-a-dollar-not-a-dollar/)
- [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
- [Learn to stop using shiny new things and love mysql](https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/learn-to-stop-using-shiny-new-things-and-love-mysql-3e1613c2ce14) - Actually I'm in love with Postgres now :), but still many points in this article still true.
- [HAProxy intro](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.9/doc/intro.txt) - It is not really important if we use HAProxy or not, it is very good explaination of how load balancer(s) work.
- [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) - Same as HAProxy, it gives very good explaination of distributed message system.
